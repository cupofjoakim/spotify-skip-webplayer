A quick chrome extension to skip the spotify webplayer and open links directly in the desktop app. The only thing it does is rewrite links to a spotify url to go via the spotify app uri. Feel free to use however you see fit.

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag skip-spotify-webplayer.crx into the page that appears.
